# Quick Audio Recorder

[简体中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

**Quick Audio Recorder** is a minimalist, yet powerful tool for Windows to quickly record audio from your microphone, system audio (loopback), or both simultaneously.  
It sits quietly in your system tray and is always ready with a single click or global hotkey.

## Contributing

If you've forked this and built something useful on top, PRs are very welcome. Same goes for bug reports, open an issue, even if it's just "doesn't work on my machine, here's what I tried."

A few things I'd find handy but haven't gotten around to: Linux/macOS support, more export formats, a proper config file instead of the current settings dialog. But honestly, anything you think makes the tool better is fair game. Keep it small and focused so it's easy to review.

## Features

### My favourite use case 💖

Quickly recording audio and pasting it anywhere, e.g. into Anki cards.  
*(Files can be set to auto-delete, so nothing stays on disk, the clip just lands in your clipboard.)*

## Installation

1.  Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/lukmay/QuickAudioRecorder/releases) page.
2.  Download `QuickAudioRecorder.exe`.
3.  Run it! (No installation required).

## Usage

1.  **Right-click** the tray icon to open **Settings**.
2.  Select your **Microphone** and **Output Folder**.
3.  Set your **Hotkeys** (optional).
4.  **Left-click** the tray icon or use a hotkey to start recording.
5.  Click again to stop. The file is saved and ready to use!

## Development

### Requirements
-   Python 3.12+
-   `pip install PyQt6 soundcard soundfile numpy lameenc keyboard`

### Build from Source
To create the standalone executable:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name QuickAudioRecorder main.py
```

### Language / 语言

The settings window supports **Follow system**, **简体中文**, and **English**. Save your preference and restart the app to apply it. Existing hotkeys and English tray-click settings are preserved.

### Windows startup and configuration

In Settings, enable **Start when I sign in to Windows** and click **Save Settings** to opt in. Disable the option and save to remove the startup entry. No administrator rights are needed. Keep the EXE at a permanent location before enabling startup. The app runs in the system tray.

Configuration is stored at `%APPDATA%\\QuickAudioRecorder\\settings.json` (legacy settings are copied on first launch). Device refresh and global hotkey registration run outside the UI thread, and saving settings no longer displays a blocking success dialog.
